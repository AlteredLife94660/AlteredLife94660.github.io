  "intro": "Welcome to my little corner of the multiverse! This is where ideas come to life, dice roll their fates, and imagination meets code.

  "journey": "For over eight years, I've been running game groups across countless worlds — from epic long-form campaigns to quick, chaotic one-shots.

Along the way, I've honed my skills in bringing people together, building systems, and exploring new creative frontiers — all while keeping a bit of fun and chaos in the mix.",

Whether through coding, game design, or community-building, I aim to make spaces where imagination thrives and everyone feels welcome — like a safe haven for nerds, dreamers, and builders of worlds.",
