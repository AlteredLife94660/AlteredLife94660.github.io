I still can't get use to being called that, it just doesn't sit right with me being responsible for others. This is the first of my personal recordings. I thought I would document my two years up here on the ring, then when I have done my service I can maybe write about them with a bit more detail. Anyway it is late and tomorrow is going to be a long day. FU-LU-HA"
